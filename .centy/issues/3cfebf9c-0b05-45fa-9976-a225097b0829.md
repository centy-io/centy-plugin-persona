# Enforce 100% test coverage

## Overview
Configure the test runner to enforce 100% code coverage across statements, branches, functions, and lines. Coverage is checked on pre-push to prevent untested code from reaching the remote.

## Tasks
- Choose and install a test framework (e.g. `vitest` or `jest`) if not already present
- Configure the coverage provider (e.g. `v8` or `istanbul`)
- Set coverage thresholds to 100% for all metrics:
  - `statements: 100`
  - `branches: 100`
  - `functions: 100`
  - `lines: 100`
- Add a `test` script: runs tests without coverage (fast, used in pre-commit)
- Add a `test:coverage` script: runs tests with coverage and enforces thresholds
- Configure coverage reporters: `text`, `lcov`, `html`
- Add `coverage/` to `.gitignore`

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running `npm run test:coverage` fails if any file falls below 100% coverage
- Coverage report is generated in `coverage/` directory
- All source files in `src/` are included in coverage (no exclusions without justification)
- The `test:coverage` script is wired into the pre-push hook
